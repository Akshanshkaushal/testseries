             <p className='con'>JEE-Advanced AIR-1<br/>
P. Sandeep Reddy, a student from Andhra Pradesh bagged the AIR 1 on Friday, June 1, 2013.

feel intimidated by exams and while at the examination centre, he felt fully confident and sure
about his preparations. Sandeep spent 12-14 hours preparing for his JEE Advanced and according br
to him JEE Mains were not really his concern area.<br/>
Along with JEE, Sandeep also topped EAMCET examination. He appeared for EAMCET to keep it just
as an option and his preparations for EAMCET began only 1 week prior to the examinations. He
felt that the EAMCET syllabus was not as difficult as the JEE and maths being his forte from the
childhood days, made his journey towards EAMCET easier. Sandeep always wanted to crack
through the JEE since his high school days but he says that he became serious towards his goal
only after class 10. Sandeep scored 98% in school exams as well!</p>

expected to bag a rank in the top 10 of JEE Advanced rankers, but he was delighted and
